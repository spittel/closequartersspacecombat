ENVIRONMENT
    -  make walls and ground invisible
    -  put in a dark world environent
	
JUICINESS
- cut in thrust sound when turning off drift
- 'feel' of acceleration FX juiciness (accel and decel)
-  figure out cockpit
    -  figure out blender enough to make a cockpit
- get sounds for thrusters
-  figure out proper movement
    - have go up and float and descend (zero grav)
    - have wasd and up and descend apply relative to view 
	- have it drift
