With edits and changes to make a newtonion physics based space shooter like asteroids.
	
- TODO: figure out proc gen rocks
   - TODO: figure out breaking up and applying momentum to smaller rocks from larger rock destroyed
	- TODO: or do a capital ship thing
- TODO: zoom shake
- TODO: figure out HUD



- 'feel' of acceleration FX juiciness (accel and decel)
-  figure out cockpit
    -  figure out blender enough to make a cockpit
- get sounds for thrusters
-  figure out proper movement
    - have go up and float and descend (zero grav)
    - have wasd and up and descend apply relative to view

GRAND IDEAS
	- shadow of the colossus but with spaceships
	- sense of speed
		- lots of debris asteroids to zoom and hide behind
		- set amount of rechargeable energy to zoom, and brake
			- zoom shake!
