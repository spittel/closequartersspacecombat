JUICINESS
	- TODO: zoom shake
	- TODO: reverse thruster sound https://freesound.org/browse/tags/thruster/?page=2#sound

	DONE
		- cut in thrust sound when turning off drift
		- 'feel' of acceleration FX juiciness (accel and decel)
		- get sounds for thrusters
		- figure out proc gen rocks for debris

GAMEPLAY
	- TODO: capital ships
			- TODO: figure out if you can color it procedurally?
			- TODO: all other bosses
			- TODO: figure out shooting 
			- TODO: figure out moving 
			- TODO: figure out turret animation
	- TODO: pilot ship
		- TODO: ship view
		
	DONE
		-  blender one BOSS up
		- drift on turns (momentum)
		- figure out proper movement
			- have go up and float and descend (zero grav)
			- have wasd and up and descend apply relative to view 
			- have it freelook
	
	
	
	
ENVIRONMENT
	- get fog to go good  https://godotshaders.com/shader/gradient-color-fog/
		- got basic fog in, not quite working
			-TODO adjust to look better

GRAND IDEAS
	NAMES:
		Close Quarters Space COmbat

		White knuckling
		Titan Killer
		Thrust
	OVERALL:
		- low poly
		- playful colour palette
			Blues, Analogous, dark to light
			#270E55 
			#0B19E3
			#0075FA
			#0BC7E3
			#0DFCB7
		- shadow of the colossus but with spaceships
		- sense of speed
			- lots of debris asteroids to zoom and hide behind
			- set amount of rechargeable energy to zoom, and brake
		- have to drift around objects to power up and/or wait out firing from capital ships
